# IMDB Poster as a Service

## tl;dr

Download posters directly from IMDB from your browser.

## Okay, tell me how!

Start the server as follows:
```console
$ go run main.go
```

Head to your browser of choice and type:
`http://0.0.0.0:8888` or `http://localhost:8888`

Now copy & paste an IMDB movie URL (e.g. `https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2293640/`) into the text field or just enter the movie's title ID (e.g. `tt2293640`) and hit "Go!"
